**Background**

This study is conducted as the final project of our statistics class in the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines at the Cagayan De Oro city campus. We were tasked by our teacher Ms. Cheryl Pagal to create a prediction model consisting of many variables called multi-regression to determine one dependent output.

Our initial idea was ought to predict a person's fastest running speed rate based on their height, weight, age, and gender alone. On December 20, 2023, we started to collect data at the university but unfortunately only managed to acquire 4 out of the total 20 required. Getting physical data was difficult due to people uninterested on our study or merely takes their time.

Our second attempt was resort to virtually look for datasets online. Most of which had either of the variables missing. We came across complete datasets but of animals and even one for pokemons. We stumbled on a gait for senior citizens open source dataset in github without more details. Eventually the data wasn't linear and barely among data showed any relationship from our hypothesis.

At one point, Joxyle, Julius, and I were at 7/11 at around 7pm under the One Avenue Express hotel and we were talking about a sustainable-development goal project that has also has commerical impact. I also reached out to Aisha since its the field she studies and is good at accounting. On December 20, 2023 Dr. Landicho sent a Code Green primer which contained a competition for an electrical energy saving project. Eventually this repository serves as the motivated starting point.
